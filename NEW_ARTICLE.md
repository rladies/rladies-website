## Article Contribution

### Create a new branch

Clone

SSH `$ git clone git@github.com:rladies/rladies-website.git`

HTTPS `$ git clone https://github.com/rladies/rladies-website.git`

or fork the project.

To create and upload an article the first thing to do is to replicate the project in a new branch. To do that from command line type:

` $ git checkout -b branch-name`

Give an intuitive name to your branch so everyone involved can guess what you did there.

### Write

Write your article in `rladies-website > website > content`. Accepted files are `.md` and `.Rmd` knited to `HTML`. It is better to use an `.Rmd` to use the tags, labels, title and date structure.

### Pull Requests

- Consider starting the commit message with ðŸ‘¾ `:space_invader:`
- Submit your branch, do not develop in master.
- Choose a _Reviewer_ if necessary.
