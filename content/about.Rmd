### About us

**R-LADIES IS A WORLDWIDE ORGANIZATION WHOSE MISSION IS TO PROMOTE GENDER DIVERSITY IN THE R COMMUNITY.**

The R community suffers from an underrepresentation of Women* in every role and area of participation, whether as leaders, package developers, conference speakers, conference participants, educations, or users.  As a diversity initiative, R-Ladies’ mission is to achieve proportionate representation by encouraging, inspiring, and empowering the minorities currently underrepresented in the R community. R-Ladies’ primary focus, therefore, is on supporting the R enthusiasts who identify as an underrepresented minority to achieve their programming potential, by building a collaborative global network of R leaders, mentors, learners, and developers to facilitate individual and collective progress worldwide.

_\*Please note all references to ‘W/women’ and ‘F/female’ within this document are used fully inclusively w.r.t trans women, genderqueer women, and non-binary people who are significantly female-identified._

### History

[Gabriela de Queiroz](https://rladies.org/united-states-rladies/name/gabriela-de-queiroz/) founded R-Ladies on October 1, 2012. She wanted to give back to the community after going to several meetups and learning a lot for free.  The first meetup was placed in San Francisco, California (United States). In the following years two more R-Ladies chapters started around the globe: Twin Cities and Taipei. R-Ladies London was the fourth chapter, which launched in March 2016. Although each chapter started working independently, the need for high-level coordination and support became evident at useR! 2016 where the San Francisco and London chapters met. After some initial brainstorming during the useR! 2016 conference, [Gabriela de Queiroz](https://rladies.org/united-states-rladies/name/gabriela-de-queiroz/) and [Erin LeDell](https://rladies.org/r-speakers/name/erin-ledell/) from R-Ladies San Francisco and [Chiin-Rui Tan](https://rladies.org/r-speakers/name/chiin-rui-tan/), [Alice Daish](https://rladies.org/ladies-complete-list/name/alice-daish/), [Hannah Frick](https://rladies.org/ladies-complete-list/name/hannah-frick/), [Rachel Kirkham](https://rladies.org/ladies-complete-list/name/rachel-kirkham/) and [Claudia Vitolo](https://rladies.org/r-speakers/name/claudia-vitolo/) from R-Ladies London as well as Heather Turner teamed up to apply for an R-Consortium [grant to support and encourage the global expansion of the R-Ladies organisation](https://github.com/rladies/global/blob/master/rconsortium/FINAL%20-%20201607-%20rconsortiumproposalr-ladiesalignmentandglobalexpansion-july2016.pdf). R-Ladies Global was born and the grant was awarded in September 2016. Since then R-Ladies has grown to 63 chapters and 13000 members, thanks to our amazing organisers and R-Ladies who helped build and maintain our [official website](https://rladies.org/), engage with the larger community via [social media](https://twitter.com/rladiesglobal) and help each-other every day in millions of different ways.
