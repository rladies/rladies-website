<h3>About us</h3>
<p><strong>R-LADIES IS A WORLDWIDE ORGANIZATION WHOSE MISSION IS TO PROMOTE GENDER DIVERSITY IN THE R COMMUNITY.</strong></p>
<p>The R community suffers from an underrepresentation of Women* in every role and area of participation, whether as leaders, package developers, conference speakers, conference participants, educations, or users. As a diversity initiative, R-Ladies’ mission is to achieve proportionate representation by encouraging, inspiring, and empowering the minorities currently underrepresented in the R community. R-Ladies’ primary focus, therefore, is on supporting the R enthusiasts who identify as an underrepresented minority to achieve their programming potential, by building a collaborative global network of R leaders, mentors, learners, and developers to facilitate individual and collective progress worldwide.</p>
<p><em>*Please note all references to ‘W/women’ and ‘F/female’ within this document are used fully inclusively w.r.t trans women, genderqueer women, and non-binary people who are significantly female-identified.</em></p>

<h3>History</h3>
<p><a href="https://rladies.org/united-states-rladies/name/gabriela-de-queiroz/">Gabriela de Queiroz</a> founded R-Ladies on October 1, 2012. She wanted to give back to the community after going to several meetups and learning a lot for free. The first meetup was placed in San Francisco, California (United States). In the following years two more R-Ladies chapters started around the globe: Twin Cities and Taipei. R-Ladies London was the fourth chapter, which launched in March 2016. Although each chapter started working independently, the need for high-level coordination and support became evident at useR! 2016 where the San Francisco and London chapters met. After some initial brainstorming during the useR! 2016 conference, <a href="https://rladies.org/united-states-rladies/name/gabriela-de-queiroz/">Gabriela de Queiroz</a> and <a href="https://rladies.org/r-speakers/name/erin-ledell/">Erin LeDell</a> from R-Ladies San Francisco and <a href="https://rladies.org/r-speakers/name/chiin-rui-tan/">Chiin-Rui Tan</a>, <a href="https://rladies.org/ladies-complete-list/name/alice-daish/">Alice Daish</a>, <a href="https://rladies.org/ladies-complete-list/name/hannah-frick/">Hannah Frick</a>, <a href="https://rladies.org/ladies-complete-list/name/rachel-kirkham/">Rachel Kirkham</a> and <a href="https://rladies.org/r-speakers/name/claudia-vitolo/">Claudia Vitolo</a> from R-Ladies London as well as Heather Turner teamed up to apply for an R-Consortium <a href="https://github.com/rladies/global/blob/master/rconsortium/FINAL%20-%20201607-%20rconsortiumproposalr-ladiesalignmentandglobalexpansion-july2016.pdf">grant to support and encourage the global expansion of the R-Ladies organisation</a>. R-Ladies Global was born and the grant was awarded in September 2016. Since then R-Ladies has grown to 63 chapters and 13000 members, thanks to our amazing organisers and R-Ladies who helped build and maintain our <a href="https://rladies.org/">official website</a>, engage with the larger community via <a href="https://twitter.com/rladiesglobal">social media</a> and help each-other every day in millions of different ways.</p>
