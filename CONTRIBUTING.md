# Contribute

This webpage will be made entirely with [Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). This way we can use all Markdown files that are already in GitHub, like the list of Chapters, and we can all collaborate in this webpage.

There's no need to be an expert on Blogdown / Webpage building to contribute to this project. Check out the list of issues and PR what you feel comfortable with.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [R-Ladies Code Of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Report unacceptable behavior to [reporting [at] rladies [dot] org](mailto:reporting@rladies.org).

## Q&A

The faster way to have a conversation about the webpage is in the #website Slack Channel. Please, don't fill an issue if you only have a question or if it is not development problems.

If you are not in the Slack channel and don't expect to be, open an issue with the label _question_.

## Ready to contribute?

Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating any issue, check the list as you might find out that you don't need to create one.

If you find a *Closed* issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### Report a bug

Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. After you've determined which repository your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in the [template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
- Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.
- Describe the behavior you observed and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.

### New features

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement or a new feature suggestion for the R-Ladies Website. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please include as many details as possible. Fill in the [template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md), including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

**Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion**

- Check it works in all devices.
- Check if you're using the version of R and packages maintainers are using, or at least a compatible version.
- Check if there's already a package which provides that enhancement.
- Determine which repository the enhancement should be suggested in.
- Perform a cursory search to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

**How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?**

- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as Markdown code blocks.
- Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
